      Welcome to Dash Hunter (“the Game”). By playing the Game or buying a tournament ticket, you agree to these Terms of Use (“Terms”). Please read them carefully.

      1. About the Game

      Dash Hunter is a skill-based mobile game currently in beta testing. It includes three rounds of challenges:

      Reaction/runner-style round

      Maze/navigation round

      Riddle/puzzle round

      Performance in each round is based on player skill, not chance.

      2. Eligibility

      You must:

      Be at least 13 years old (or the legal age in your region).

      Have permission from a parent/guardian if you’re under 18.

      Live in a location where skill-based games are allowed.

      3. Tournament Tickets & Payments

      Tournament entry requires purchasing a ticket through Stripe, our payment processor.

      All payments are handled securely by Stripe.

      Prices for tickets may change over time.

      Tickets are non-refundable, except where required by law.

      A valid purchase gives access to one tournament round (not the entire app).

      4. No Gambling

      Dash Hunter does not offer gambling and does not allow wagering.

      No bets are placed.

      No random chance determines outcomes.

      Player results are based on skill, reaction time, decision-making, and puzzle-solving.

      5. Player Conduct

      You agree not to:

      Cheat, exploit bugs, or use any unauthorized tools or mods.

      Attempt to manipulate tournaments, scores, or leaderboards.
